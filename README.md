# Robotics Software for the FIRST Tech Challenge

This repository contains code for a robot designed for the [FIRST Tech Challenge Info](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc), a worldwide competition where teams try to score points by accomplishing various 
tasks on a playing field.

Among these files you'll find:
1. OpenCV-based computer vision algorithms
2. Algorithms for autonomous robot driving
3. Program for a robotic arm

For more detailed descriptions please refer to our [Engineering Notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10ZbTJVGZZdXm0vC8-VPeun7FNLMnCYfn/view?usp=sharing)

To see the robot in action please take a look at these [videos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/EhdhvV14db5P6dAF6)

Please note: if you'd like to use the programs for your robot, you need to have the FTC SDK installed as well as the libraries discussed in the engineering notebook.
